## Getting Started
This program only works on Windows (XP to 10).  Moreover Cygwin and the most basic packages are required for this program to work.
Once you download the shell script (or the executable), chmod +x it, and then you will be able to run it.  You can create an alias for it too.

### Using the Binaries
Just download the zipped folder, extract the executable, and run it.  And alias can be created for it too.  The exectuable is just a compiled version of the script made with SHC.

## Usage
    -v                 Display script version
    -h                 Display this file
